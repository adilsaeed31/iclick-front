# v2.0.0-rc.10

This is our second release candidate for this project. This project should be considered `pre-release` until we've released the final 2.0.0 version.

This version should be used with `v2.0.0-rc.10` of https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction

# Improvements

### Dev Utilities

- We have made it easier to debug and troubleshoot issues in our Docker image:
  (#504)

### General

- We added a new new profile address book page (#499)
- We added support for GraphQL Subscriptions (#492)
- We added the ability to get sitemap data from GQL API and make it available on sitemap\*.xml routes (#488)
- We added the ability to have surcharges attached to an order (#499)

# Breaking Changes

### Multiple Payment Support

- All of the individual `placeOrder*` GraphQL mutations provided by the built-in payment plugins are removed and replaced with a single `placeOrder` mutation which supports multiple payments. Any custom payment method plugins will break due to the removal of `createOrder` internal mutation. Look at all changes. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4908)
